# ConnectIQ PaidFeatures Example App
Example ConnectIQ project using the [PaidFeatures Barrel](https://github.com/Remoh007/connectiq-paidFeatures-barrel) to unlock Features

## Explanation
The PaidFeatures Barrel lets the user unlock Features by entering correct codes via the settings.  
This example app shows this by showing/hiding menu items based on the status of these features.  
One Unlock Code is "ITEM3"  
The other two unlock codes can be seen in the Debug Console and can be tested.  
The View for DeviceInfos is also provided by the barrel, which can be used out of the box.
